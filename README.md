Klipper backup script for manual or automated GitHub backups 

This backup is provided by [Klipper-Backup](https://github.com/Staubgeborener/klipper-backup).

This is Ebbastor's Klipper printer config files. The config files have been organized in a way that each component of the printer has its own .cfg file, making it easy to modify the config file when replacing components.

Feel free to use this klipper config for your reference!
